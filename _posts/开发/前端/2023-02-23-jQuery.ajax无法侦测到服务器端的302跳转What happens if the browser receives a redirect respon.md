jQuery.ajax无法侦测到服务器端的302跳转What happens if the browser receives a redirect respon

If the server sends a redirect (aka a 302 response plus a Location: header) the redirect is automatically followed by the browser. The response to the second request (assuming it also isn't another redirect) is what is exposed to your program.

In fact, you don't have the ability to detect whether a 302 response has occurred. If the 302 redirect leads to a 200, then your program acts identically as if the original request led directly to a 200.

This has been both my experience and the behavior called out in the spec.

The AJAX request never has the opportunity to NOT follow the redirect (i.e., it must follow the redirect). More information can be found in this answer http://stackoverflow.com/a/2573589/965648
