nginx无法解决域名的问题(关闭ipv6)

We figured out that the problem had to do with our DNS resolver not supporting ipv6. We disabled ipv6 within the Ngnix config file and it worked. Just had to add "ipv6=off" after the dns resolver address.

Final config file:

worker_processes  1;

events {
   worker_connections  1024;
}


http {
   include           mime.types;
   default_type      application/octet-stream;
   sendfile          on;
   keepalive_timeout 65;

   server {
       listen       80;

       location / {
           resolver 127.0.0.1 ipv6=off;
           proxy_pass http://$host;
       }
   }
}
